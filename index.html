            <center><h3>¡Hola a todos!</h3></center>

            <p>¡Bienvenidos a mi página Web! In this page you will be updated with current activities and assignments that will be carried out during the school year. You will also find announcements, resources, links and important information that will help your child succeed in the Spanish class.</p>

            <p>This year I have planned many fun activities and projects that are exciting to me! I have started the YouTube Channel for the Spanish class called: ILOVESPANISH! In this channel, students have the opportunity to share their likes and knowledge through this platform in a second language. Also, they have the chance to practice technology skills needed in the 21st century.</p>
            
            <p>Among other exciting projects, we continue with different missions to collect school supplies or children clothes, especially coats and garments for the cold weather to give to people in need. Last year, the students collaborated and organized “Mission Peru.” They collected many items that I brought to Peru during my Graduate Studies with Rutgers University in the Summer of 2018. It was a huge success! This was an amazing experience for my students, families and myself. I hope to continue this journey of helping and learning about empathy in collaboration with the staff, students, families and the community. You are an integral part of this journey!</p>
            
            <p>Another project for this year would be: organizing Skype video conferences for students to learn about cultural aspects of Spanish speaking countries and practice their Spanish, among others.</p>
            
            <p>Also, it’s important to highlight some characteristics that are essential and valued in my classroom. These are: responsibility, respect, punctuality, patience, creativity and empathy.</p>
